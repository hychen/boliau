## Adding new features

This section includes advice on how to build new features for the project & what kind of process it includes. 

* This is how we like people to add new features:
* Here are some specifics on the coding style we prefer: PEP8, Google Python Coding Style
* This is how you send your pull request: please use github to send
  pull request.
* You should include the following tests:
  * Write test case of your code in test/ before you start coding.
  * Pass tests by running nosetest before commit or send pull request.
* These are the updates we hope you make to the changelog: file name,
  summary of changes.

Don’t get discouraged! We estimate that the response time from the
maintainers is around:
